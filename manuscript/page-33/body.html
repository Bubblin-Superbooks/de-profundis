<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">springtime once in my heart.  My temperament was akin to joy.  I filled my life to the very brim with pleasure, as one might fill a cup to the very brim with wine.  Now I am approaching life from a completely new standpoint, and even to conceive happiness is often extremely difficult for me.  I remember during my first term at Oxford reading in Pater’s <em>Renaissance_—that book which has had such strange influence over my life—how Dante places low in the Inferno those who wilfully live in sadness; and going to the college library and turning to the passage in the _Divine Comedy</em> where beneath the dreary marsh lie those who were ‘sullen in the sweet air,’ saying for ever and ever through their sighs—</p><blockquote><p>‘Tristi fummo<br>Nell aer dolce che dal sol s’allegra.’</p></blockquote></div> </div>
